# CI/CD Setup Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the current CI/CD setup for the Dgraph Client Application and outlines the roadmap for future improvements.

## Current Status

### ✅ **Implemented**
- **GitHub Actions workflows** for basic CI
- **pnpm package manager** integration
- **Basic dependency management** and security auditing
- **Automated setup verification** (Node.js, pnpm, dependencies)

### ⚠️ **Current Limitations**
- **Build process** has compilation errors that need resolution
- **Test suite** has failing tests that need debugging
- **TypeScript errors** prevent full type checking
- **Linting issues** need to be addressed

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. Main CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Purpose**: Basic setup verification and security checks

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches

**Jobs**:

#### Setup Check
- Verifies Node.js 20.x setup
- Confirms pnpm 10.0.0 installation
- Installs dependencies with `--frozen-lockfile`
- Lists installed packages for verification

#### Security Audit
- Runs `pnpm audit` with moderate security level
- Checks for outdated dependencies
- Identifies potential security vulnerabilities

### 2. Dependency Management (`.github/workflows/dependencies.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated dependency updates and security monitoring

**Triggers**:
- Weekly schedule (Mondays 9 AM UTC)
- Manual dispatch via GitHub Actions

**Features**:
- Automated security audits
- Outdated dependency detection
- Pull request creation for updates (when implemented)

## Local Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Check pnpm version
pnpm --version

# Check Node.js version
node --version

# List installed packages
pnpm list --depth=0

# Security audit
pnpm audit --audit-level moderate

# Check outdated dependencies
pnpm outdated
```

## Roadmap for Full CI Implementation

### Phase 1: Fix Current Issues (Priority: High)
- [ ] Resolve TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Fix missing exports in utility files
- [ ] Address linting warnings and errors
- [ ] Debug and fix failing tests

### Phase 2: Enhanced Testing (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Implement comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting
- [ ] Set up visual regression testing
- [ ] Add performance testing

### Phase 3: Advanced CI Features (Priority: Low)
- [ ] Multi-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Multiple Node.js version support
- [ ] Automated dependency updates
- [ ] Build artifact deployment
- [ ] Code quality gates

## Current Issues to Resolve

### 1. Missing Exports
Several utility functions are not properly exported:
- `detectVariables` from `dqlVariables.ts`
- `extractDeclaredVariables` from `dqlVariables.ts`
- `validateVariableValue` from `dqlVariables.ts`
- `hasNamedQueryWithVars` from `dqlVariables.ts`

### 2. TypeScript Errors
- Schema type mismatches
- Missing type definitions
- Implicit any types

### 3. Test Failures
- Component rendering issues
- Mock setup problems
- Event handling failures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Check TypeScript errors
pnpm type-check

# Check linting issues
pnpm lint

# Verify dependencies
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

#### Test Failures
```bash
# Run specific test file
pnpm test --testPathPattern="ComponentName"

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
pnpm test:watch
```

#### Dependency Issues
```bash
# Clean and reinstall
pnpm clean
pnpm install

# Update lockfile
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
```

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Always run local checks** before pushing:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm lint
   pnpm type-check
   pnpm test
   ```

2. **Use conventional commits** for better CI integration

3. **Test locally** with the same Node.js version as CI (20.x)

### For CI/CD
1. **Fail fast** - Stop on first critical error
2. **Cache dependencies** - Use pnpm store caching
3. **Parallel jobs** - Run independent checks simultaneously
4. **Clear reporting** - Provide actionable error messages

## Monitoring and Metrics

### CI Status Badge
Add this to your README:
```markdown
![CI](https://github.com/{username}/{repo}/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
```

### Coverage Badge
Once test coverage is implemented:
```markdown
![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/{username}/{repo}/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)
```

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- [ ] Weekly dependency security audits
- [ ] Monthly Node.js version updates
- [ ] Quarterly dependency major version reviews
- [ ] Annual CI workflow optimization

### Getting Help
- Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed error information
- Review this documentation for common solutions
- Create issues for persistent problems
- Consult the testing documentation in `TESTING.md`

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced CI Features
- **Performance monitoring** with Lighthouse CI
- **Bundle analysis** with webpack-bundle-analyzer
- **E2E testing** with Playwright or Cypress
- **Mobile testing** with device emulation
- **Accessibility testing** with axe-core

### Deployment Automation
- **Staging deployments** on pull requests
- **Production deployments** on main branch
- **Rollback capabilities** for failed deployments
- **Environment-specific configurations**
