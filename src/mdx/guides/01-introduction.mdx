# Introduction to Dgraph Query Language

Dgraph Query Language (DQL) is a query language designed to efficiently query graph data stored in Dgraph databases.

## Setting Up Your First Schema

Before we start querying, let's define a simple schema for a movie database:

```dql-schema
type Person {
  name: string @index(term) .
  age: int .
  starred_in: [uid] @reverse .
}

type Movie {
  title: string @index(term) .
  year: int @index(int) .
  genre: string @index(exact) .
  director: uid @reverse .
  starring: [uid] @reverse .
}
```

## Adding Sample Data

Let's insert some sample movie data to work with:

```dql-mutation
{
  set {
    _:tom <name> "Tom Hanks" .
    _:tom <age> "67" .
    _:tom <dgraph.type> "Person" .
    
    _:meg <name> "Meg Ryan" .
    _:meg <age> "62" .
    _:meg <dgraph.type> "Person" .
    
    _:forrest <title> "Forrest Gump" .
    _:forrest <year> "1994" .
    _:forrest <genre> "Drama" .
    _:forrest <starring> _:tom .
    _:forrest <dgraph.type> "Movie" .
    
    _:seattle <title> "Sleepless in Seattle" .
    _:seattle <year> "1993" .
    _:seattle <genre> "Romance" .
    _:seattle <starring> _:tom .
    _:seattle <starring> _:meg .
    _:seattle <dgraph.type> "Movie" .
  }
}
```

## Your First Query

Now let's query our movie database to find all people and their movies:

```dql-query
{
  people(func: has(name)) {
    uid
    name
    age
    movies: ~starring {
      title
      year
      genre
    }
  }
}
```

Click the queries above to run them interactively! DQL uses a GraphQL-like syntax but with functions specifically designed for graph databases.

## Understanding the Query Structure

- `func: has(name)` - Finds all nodes that have a `name` predicate
- `~starring` - Reverse edge traversal (movies where this person starred)
- `uid` - Always include this for proper graph visualization
