# Introduction to Dgraph Query Language

Dgraph Query Language (DQL) is a query language designed to efficiently query graph data stored in Dgraph databases.

## Your First Query

Try this simple query to get all nodes that have a `name` property:

```dql-query
{
  q(func: has(name)) {
    uid
    name
  }
}
```

Click the query above to load it into the editor, then click "Run Query" to execute it.

DQL uses a GraphQL-like syntax but with functions specifically designed for graph databases.
