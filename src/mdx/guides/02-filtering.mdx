# Filtering Data in DQL

DQL provides powerful filtering capabilities using the `func` parameter in your queries.

## Filter by Predicate Value

This query finds all people who are older than 30:

```dql-query
{
  older_people(func: gt(age, 30)) {
    uid
    name
    age
  }
}
```

## String Filtering with Regular Expressions

You can use regular expressions to find patterns in string values:

```dql-query
{
  people_with_j(func: regexp(name, /^J.*$/)) {
    uid
    name
  }
}
```

This will find all people whose names start with the letter 'J'.
