# Filtering Data in DQL

DQL provides powerful filtering capabilities using the `func` parameter in your queries.

## Filter by Predicate Value

This query finds all movies from the 1990s:

```dql-query
{
  nineties_movies(func: between(year, 1990, 1999)) {
    uid
    title
    year
    genre
    starring {
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```

## String Filtering with Regular Expressions

You can use regular expressions to find patterns in string values:

```dql-query
{
  tom_movies(func: regexp(name, /^Tom.*$/)) {
    uid
    name
    age
    movies: ~starring {
      title
      year
      genre
    }
  }
}
```

## Genre-Based Filtering

Filter movies by specific genres:

```dql-query
{
  romance_movies(func: eq(genre, "Romance")) {
    uid
    title
    year
    starring {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

This will find all romance movies and their starring actors.
