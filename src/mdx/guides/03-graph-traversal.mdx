# Graph Traversal in DQL

One of the most powerful features of Dgraph is the ability to traverse relationships between nodes.

## Basic Relationship Traversal

This query finds actors and the movies they've starred in:

```dql-query
{
  actors(func: has(name)) @filter(type(Person)) {
    uid
    name
    age
    movies: ~starring {
      uid
      title
      year
      genre
    }
  }
}
```

## Multi-level Traversal with Co-stars

Find actors, their movies, and their co-stars:

```dql-query
{
  actors_and_costars(func: has(name)) @filter(type(Person)) @cascade {
    uid
    name
    movies: ~starring {
      uid
      title
      year
      co_stars: starring @filter(not eq(name, val(actor_name))) {
        uid
        name
        age
      }
    }
  }
  
  # Get the actor's name for filtering
  var(func: has(name)) @filter(type(Person)) {
    actor_name as name
  }
}
```

## Reverse Edge Traversal

Use reverse edges to find relationships from different perspectives:

```dql-query
{
  movies_by_actor(func: eq(name, "Tom Hanks")) {
    name
    age
    filmography: ~starring {
      uid
      title
      year
      genre
      other_actors: starring @filter(not eq(name, "Tom Hanks")) {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This demonstrates how graph databases excel at representing and querying complex relationships!
