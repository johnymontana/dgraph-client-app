# Graph Traversal in DQL

One of the most powerful features of Dgraph is the ability to traverse relationships between nodes.

## Basic Relationship Traversal

This query finds people and their friends:

```dql-query
{
  people(func: has(name)) {
    name
    age
    friend {
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```

## Multi-level Traversal

You can traverse multiple levels of relationships:

```dql-query
{
  people(func: has(name)) @cascade {
    name
    friend {
      name
      friend {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This query finds people, their friends, and their friends' friends, creating a 2-level social network visualization.
